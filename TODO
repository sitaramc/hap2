TODO

Right now, hap2 uses a fixed format file that is manually edited.

Ideally, hap2 will have a wrapper that maintains this file, and maybe a UI of
some sort, to provide the following features:

  * generate and save random salt for a site
  * mark some sites "high risk" and force a longer master password for them
  * set number of rounds for a site (currently hardcoded to 1 million)
  * save miscellaneous notes for a site
  * keep a log so you can see when you last logged on to a site
  * support sites that have max key lengths or other rules for passwords

hap2 will of course change a bit to accommodate all this (like honor the max
key length setting, etc) but most of it will be in the wrapper program.
