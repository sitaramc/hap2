TODO

Ideally, hap2 will have a wrapper that maintains a simple database, and a UI
of some sort, to provide the following features:

  * generate and save random salt for a site
  * remember salt for all sites
  * set key length for a site
  * mark some sites "high risk" and force a longer master password for them
  * set number of rounds for a site (currently hardcoded to 1 million)
  * save miscellaneous notes for a site
  * keep a log so you can see when you last logged on to a site

hap2 will of course change a bit to accommodate all this (like take more
command line options), but most of it will be in the wrapper program.
