(note: when I mentioned "linkedin" below, take that to mean any generic site
that happened to lose a few hundred thousand password hashes, salted or not).

other notes

  - from http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/06/a_really_good_a.html

      - just heard of "Password Hasher" addon for firefox

      - someone argues that an encrypted vault is just as secure as a hasher

        my thoughts:

          - case 1: if you don't know my actual password to some site (via a
            weakness in that site, or whatever), then, with a hasher, there is
            no target to search.  You just have an algorithm, and no more
            info!

            With an encrypted database, you still have a target for your brute
            force attempts.

            (NOTE: this assumes a correct decryption can be "recognised" in
            some way, like perhaps it has some metadata or tags or has only
            printable characters, or whatever.  However, if the decrypted data
            *also* looks like random binary blob then I agree it is secure.
            I'm not sure how many of them satisfy this condition though.)

          - case 2: if you *do* know my actual password to some site, then
            both appear to be equally secure, I agree.  You have a target to
            search and an algorithm.

      - same person mentions changing the password to just *one* site, not
        all.  I think this is covered by my TODO, clearly such a database
        (plus UI, ideally) is needed to use a hasher.  Once you have that,
        this point goes away.

      - oh goody, Clive Robinson says passwords are unlikely to disappear
        anytime soon!  Finally, someone else thinking the same!
